            </figure>
            <p>Of all the openings that don’t begin by advancing the king’s pawn or the queen’s pawn, the English
                Opening is among the most popular. White immediately grabs some central space and takes the d5 square
                under control.</p>
            <h2>How to Play the English Opening</h2>
            <p>White may choose to transpose to a Queen's Pawn Opening or, less frequently, a King's Pawn Opening
                depending on how black proceeds. For example, after 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6, white can choose to play 3. d4,
                which is a Queen's Pawn Opening.</p>
            <p>This article will concentrate on lines that are unique to the English Opening and do not translate to
                other systems. Consider the following three popular continuations:</p>
            <p>• Black grabs the center with 1…e5 (The “Reversed Sicilian”)</p>
            <p>• Black plays 1…c5 (The Symmetrical English)</p>
            <p>• Black prepares to play 2…d5 and challenge white in the center</p>
            <h2>1. c4 e5 – “The Reversed Sicilian”</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-reversed-sicilian.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>At first glance, this appears to be a Sicilian Defense with reversed colors, but the play frequently
                deviates from the Sicilian. Because white gets an extra move in this opening, black is less likely to go
                for some of the sharpest, most double-edged continuations, where every move counts, than white is in the
                Sicilian Defense.</p>
            <p>One of the main lines is 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 e4</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-reversed-sicilian-defense-2.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After 7. Ng5, it may appear that black is overextending his e-pawn, but white is attacking this pawn
                three times! But after 7 p.m.... Bxc3 8. bxc3 Re8 black successfully defends it.</p>
            <p>White has a large mass of central pawns, but he also has doubled pawns, and black's e-pawn can be a thorn
                in white's side if not dealt with. White also keeps both bishops, whereas black does not. If the
                position becomes available, white may benefit.</p>
            <h2>1. c4 c5 – The Symmetrical English</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-symmetrical-english-1.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a consistent way for black to respond to the English Opening. Black simply "copies" white's first
                move and takes his own central space!</p>
            <p>Because both sides have similar plans, it's common for the symmetry to continue for a few moves in this
                line. For instance, 1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. 0-0 0-0</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-symmetrical-english-2.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a common time for white to break the copycat game and capitalize on their first-move advantage!
                White is frequently the first to create pawn tension with 7. d4.</p>
            <p>White gains a space advantage whether black exchanges on d4 or allows white's queen's pawn to remain in
                the center. Of course, black's position is solid, and he has no reason to be concerned.</p>
            <h2>Black strikes back with …d5</h2>
            <p>Another option black has is to prepare to challenge white’s c-pawn by playing …d5</p>
            <p>The instant 1...d5?! Is not regarded favorably. Black cannot recapture with a pawn after 2. cxd5. After
                2...Qxd5, White will be able to kick the queen away while developing a piece. 3. Nc3, and unlike in the
                Scandinavian Defense (1. e4 d5), white gains the long-term advantage of two central pawns to one!</p>
            <p>Instead, let’s consider 1. c4 e6 2. Nf3 d5</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-english-opening-challenged.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Of course, White can play 3. d4 and transpose to a line of the Queen's Gambit. However, white has a
                couple of options for keeping the game in English Opening territory.</p>
            <p>By playing 3. g3, White frequently ignores black's threat to the c-pawn. If black plays 3…dxc4:, White
                can either rush to recover the pawn with 4. Qa4+, or simply continue development with 4. Bg2. The
                temporary loss of the c-pawn in this manner, like in many Queen's Pawn Openings, is often not a concern
                for white - it will be difficult for black to hold onto this pawn for long without falling behind in
                development.</p>
            <p>White, on the other hand, can defend the c-pawn. For instance, following 1. c4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. b3 Nf6 4.
                g3 Be7 5. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 c5 7. Bb2:</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/the-english-opening-challenged-2.png"
                    alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
                <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>White's playing a double-fianchetto system, where both bishops exert pressure on the center from afar.
                White can later strike in the center with their central pawns that have yet to be touched.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The English Opening is a popular white opening system. The c-pawn effectively controls central space
                while allowing white to maintain flexibility in the deployment of their two central pawns.</p>
