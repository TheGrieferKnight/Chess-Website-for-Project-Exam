    <h1>Rules of Chess</h1>
    <p>
      Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered board consisting
      of 64 squares, 32 of which are light and 32 of which are dark. The game is
      won by checkmating the opponent’s king, which means putting the king in a
      position where it is under attack (in check) and there is no legal move to
      escape capture (mate).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
      knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The game begins with the pieces
      arranged on the board as follows:
    </p>
    <p>

        style="display: block; margin: auto"
      />
    </p>
    <p>The pieces move as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The king moves one square in any direction.</li>
      <li>
        The queen moves any number of squares in a straight line along a rank,
        file, or diagonal.
      </li>
      <li>The rook moves any number of squares along a rank or file.</li>
      <li>The bishop moves any number of squares along a diagonal.</li>
      <li>
        The knight moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then
        one square at a right angle.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pawn moves forward one square, but on its first move it may move two
        squares. Pawns capture diagonally one square forward. Pawns can also
        perform an en passant capture if an opponent’s pawn advances two squares
        from its starting position and lands next to the first pawn.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A piece may be moved to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, which is
      then captured and removed from the board. A player may not move a piece
      onto a square occupied by one of their own pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is played with alternating turns, with white moving first. A
      player may not make a move that puts or leaves their own king in check. If
      a player’s king is in check, they must make a move that removes the threat
      of capture, either by moving the king, blocking the attacking piece, or
      capturing the attacking piece.
    </p>
    <p>The game can end in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Checkmate: When a player’s king is in check and there is no legal move
        to escape capture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stalemate: When a player is not in check, but has no legal move to make.
      </li>
      <li>
        Draw: When the same position occurs three times, when both players agree
        to a draw, or when a player has insufficient material to checkmate their
        opponent (e.g. only a king left on the board).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope this helps you understand the rules of chess!</p>
