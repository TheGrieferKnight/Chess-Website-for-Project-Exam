      <p>
        White immediately seizes control of the center and opens lines of
        development for his pieces - 1. e4 is clearly in line with opening
        principles. Many top-tier chess players favor the King's Pawn Opening, and
        World Champion Bobby Fischer even called it the "Best by test."
      </p>
      <p>
        Black has several responses to the King’s Pawn Opening. I’m going to break
        them down into three categories:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Black immediately seizes their share of central space (the symmetrical
        1...e5 or the more double-edged Sicilian Defense: 1...c5).</p>
      <p>• With his d-pawn, Black attacks the white center. (The Scandinavian
        Defense is played immediately after 1...d5, whereas the French Defense
        and Caro-Kann Defense are played after 1...e6 or 1...c6 with the
        intention of following up with 2...d5.)</p>
      <p>• Other defenses where black is not attempting to occupy the center with a
        pawn. White is frequently allowed to construct a large center, but all
        is not lost for black, as we will see shortly!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/1.E4 E5.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Black Occupies the Center: 1…e5</h2>
      <p>
        For much of chess's history, 1. e4 e5 was by far the most common opening
        move. We've discussed the benefits of white's first move, so why shouldn't
        black want to replicate it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, 1...e5 is advantageous for the same reasons that 1. E4 is
        advantageous. This is the most common response taught to beginners, and it
        is used all the way up to the World Championship level. Black establishes
        a stronghold in the center and creates lines for his pieces to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll spend a lot of time on this option because it has so many opening
        variations!
      </p>
      <p>
        White typically follows with the extremely logical 2. Nf3. It's difficult
        to ask for more from an opening move than this - white develops a knight,
        moves closer to kingside castling, and directly threatens black's e5 pawn!
        The most common response is 2...Nc6 - black defends the threat against e5
        while also developing his own piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this section, we'll look at alternatives to 2. Nf3 and
        2...Nc6 - but first, let's see how the game can progress from the
        following position:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/1.E4 E5 2.NF3 NC6.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The Ruy Lopez, perhaps the most well-known of the King's Pawn Openings, is
        one of the oldest chess openings - after all, it's named after a 16th
        century Spanish priest!
      </p>
      <p>
        And there's a reason it's still popular. White creates a bishop, moves
        closer to casting, and gives black something to worry about: White could
        threaten to exchange this bishop for the black knight on c6, leaving
        black's e5 pawn undefended at the right time!
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Bc4, also known as the Italian Game, is another popular option for
        white. White's bishop looks menacingly at the f7 square, black's weakest
        point, and white is ready to castle next turn if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scotch Game is composed of 3. d4. Before continuing with piece
        development, White decides to open up the center and create some pawn
        tension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ponziani Opening, c3, is difficult to master. White's plan is
        ambitious: on the next turn, he wants to play 4. d4, but unlike in the
        Scotch (see above), if black exchanges his e-pawn for the d-pawn, white
        will be able to recapture with a pawn and maintain a dominant grip in the
        center!
      </p>
      <p>
        3. After black plays the natural 3...Nf6, Nc3 frequently leads to the Four
        Knights Game. The position remains symmetrical, and a little dull in
        comparison to white's more ambitious options listed above - but hey,
        having the move in a symmetrical position can't be a bad thing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before proceeding, consider some second-move alternatives for both white
        and black following 1. e4 e5:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/1.E4 E5.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Instead of the hugely popular 2. Nf3, white has some alternatives:</p>
      <p>
        The aggressive King's Gambit is f4. White immediately attempts to dislodge
        black's e5 pawn from its stronghold in the center, even if it means giving
        up a pawn!
      </p>
      <p>
        F4 is the aggressive King's Gambit. White immediately tries to dislodge
        black's e5 pawn from its central stronghold, even if it means giving up a
        pawn!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Center Game is d4. White can either recapture with the queen after
        2...exd4, or play the aggressive 3. c3. This is the Danish Gambit, in
        which white sacrifices a pawn in order to gain a development advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bc4, developing a bishop, is certainly reasonable, but this King's Pawn
        Opening is unlikely to stay in original territory unless white makes some
        speculative moves. White will most likely play Nf3 or Nc3 soon, switching
        to an Italian Opening or Vienna Game (see above).
      </p>
      <p>However, some unique lines such as the Urusov Gambit are possible!</p>
      <p>
        Other options exist, such as 2. Qh5 (The Wayward Queen Attack), but are
        generally regarded as no threat to black with proper play. After 2. Nf3,
        black has some options if they want to avoid the logical 2...Nc6:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/KnightF3.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The Petrov Defense is 2...Nf6. Instead of defending the e-pawn, black
        attacks white's e-pawn!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Philidor Defense is 2...d6. Black defends the e5 pawn calmly, clearing
        the way for his light bishop to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Latvian Gambit and the so-called Elephant Gambit are played at
        2...f5?! and 2...d5?!, respectively. These pawn thrusts are considered
        dubious, but they can be dangerous against an unprepared opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        2…f6? Is the fundamentally flawed Damiano Defense. This is not how you
        defend your e-pawn! White can ignore the f6 pawn and go for e5. 3. Nxe5!
        This black setup is refuted.
      </p>
      <h2>Black occupies the center: 1…c5 – The Sicilian Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/the-sicilian-defense.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The Sicilian Defense is a bold, ambitious response to the King's Pawn
        Opening that appeals to players of all skill levels. In accordance with
        opening principles, Black seizes their share of central space - but
        immediately creates a stark imbalance in the position.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, this move appears to be inferior to 1...e5. Black gains
        space in the Sicilian, but the move 1...c5 does not provide as many
        opportunities for piece development. This pawn move exposes only the
        queen, and we know that the queen does not usually develop early!
      </p>
      <p>But consider White's alternatives:</p>
      <p>
        True, white is likely to gain an advantage in development in the Sicilian,
        but if white wants to open the center and try to exploit it before black
        does, white will almost certainly need to play d4 at some point. Then
        black gets to exchange his c-pawn for white's more central d-pawn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black has the long-term advantage of having two central pawns to white's
        one, and the black position is compact and without weaknesses. Of course,
        if white does not want to play an early d4 pawn break, he has other
        options. White will occasionally play an early f4 and gradually build up
        on the kingside, where white is assured of a space advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such cases, Black frequently builds up on the queenside and
        occasionally organizes a strike in the center himself with...d5, if his
        piece development justifies it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever white does, black is guaranteed an unbalanced, dynamic game - a
        Sicilian Defense player's dream!
      </p>
      <h2>Black Center Strikes: 1...d5 - The Scandinavian Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/the-scandinavian-defense.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        It's tempting to strike white's King's Pawn right away. Black immediately
        makes it clear that white's e-pawn will not be allowed to stay on e4 for
        long!
      </p>
      <p>
        It's tempting to immediately strike white's King's Pawn. Black quickly
        establishes that white's e-pawn will not be allowed to remain on e4 for
        long!
      </p>
      <p>
        It's tempting to strike white's King's Pawn right away. White's e-pawn
        will not be allowed to remain on e4 for long, as Black quickly
        establishes!
      </p>
      <h2>Black Strikes at the Center: 1…e6 – The French Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/the-french-defense1.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The French Defense to the King's Pawn Opening is formed by first playing
        1...e6 and then 2...d5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obvious disadvantage of spending a move preparing to strike before
        lashing out in the center is that white gains another move to bolster
        their center! After 1. e4 e6, the most common move is 2. d4. White
        occupies the entire center for the time being, and both white bishops have
        open lines to develop on.
      </p>
      <p>After 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/the-french-defense2.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        3. exd5 is now harmless, but playable, in contrast to the Scandinavian
        Defense (see above). Black retains their central foothold by recapturing
        with the e-pawn rather than the queen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, white frequently plays 3. e5, securing a space advantage and
        locking up the center, or 3. Nd2 or 3. Nc3, simply defending the e4 pawn
        threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The French Defense has a significant disadvantage in that black's
        light-square bishop on c8 is severely restricted by black's pawns. If
        black does not solve the "problem of the bishop," this can be a long-term
        problem for him throughout the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the French Defense is still popular at nearly all chess
        levels.
      </p>
      <h2>Black Strikes at the Center: 1…c6 – The Caro-Kann Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets\the-caro-kann-defense1.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        It would be difficult to understand the purpose of this move without first
        understanding the French and Scandinavian defenses mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following position after 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5, which is
        analogous to the French Defense position in the preceding section:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets\the-caro-kann-defense2.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Black avoids the disadvantage of the Scandinavian Defense: if white
        captures on d5, black can recapture with a pawn and keep control of the
        center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black also tries to avoid the disadvantages of the French Defense! For the
        time being, Black leaves the development path for his light-squared bishop
        open. Black wants to develop this bishop to f5 or g4, then play...e6 to
        clear the way for the other bishop and complete development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black achieves this goal in many of the most common continuations. Rather
        than being a lame duck on c8, as in the French Defense, black's
        light-squared-bishop in the Caro-Kann is frequently rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the Caro-Kann truly the best of both worlds? Not so quickly. The
        obvious disadvantage is that this clever operation takes time, and 1...c6
        isn't a particularly useful move for immediate piece development.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the Caro remains a reputable opening used by several Grandmasters
        - and it has been a staple of my opening repertoire throughout my chess
        career, so I'm biased!
      </p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: 1…Nf6 – The Alekhine Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="the-alekhine-defense.png"
          alt="a smiling person in a pink hoodie, standing in front of a bright pink lighted arcade basketball game. " />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This provocative move, named after World Champion Alexander Alekhine, attacks white's e-pawn from move 1 -
        before
        black has secured any central space!</p>
      <p>The obvious disadvantage of this opening is that white can play 2. e5, gaining more space and kicking away this
        knight. White has a clear space advantage after 1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4, and can even play c4 soon, gaining
        more
        space and kicking the black knight again!</p>
      <p>In the near future, white may play c4 and f4 - the "Four Pawns Attack." In an attempt to punish black for the
        provocative opening choice, white seeks to gain an overwhelming space advantage and deprive the black pieces of
        any
        good squares!
      <p>As a result, the Alekhine Defense has never been regarded as a top-tier defense against the King's Pawn
        Opening,
        but it's not as bad as it appears! White can overextend if not careful, and black has some setups figured out
        that
        allow his pieces to breathe freely despite white's space advantage. The nearly universal 3...d6 begins the
        process
        of tearing down the white center.</p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: 1…d6 – The Pirc Defense</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets\thepircdefense.png" alt="1.E4 D6" />
        <figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When black does not want to occupy the center, the Pirc Defense is another option. Black wants to play 2...Nf6,
        attacking white's e-pawn, but first plays 1...d6 to avoid being hit with an early e5 from white (as in the
        Alekhine
        Defense above)</p>
      <p>Early on, Black frequently plays...g6,...Bg7, and...0-0. While black does not directly occupy the center, his
        knight and dark-square bishop exert indirect pressure on white's center, and the black king is safely tucked
        away.
        Later, with...e5,...c5, or even...d5, black may attempt to organize a strike at the white center.</p>
      <p>The Pirc's adaptability has piqued the interest of many chess players of all levels. However, the disadvantage
        is
        clear: white faces no challenge to their central control early on and is free to play 2. d4 and develop in
        nearly
        any way they want.</p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: 1…g6 – The Modern Defense</h2>\
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/the-modern-defense.png" alt="1.E4 G6" />
        figcaption>Screenshot by Fabian Steineck</figcaption>

      <p>The Modern Defense is a close relative of the Pirc Defense (see above), and it frequently transposes to the
        Pirc
        if
        black plays...d6 and...Nf6 in the near future. By placing the dark bishop on g7, black foregoes the fight for
        central dominance in favor of flexibility and indirect pressure on white's center.</p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: 1…b6 – The Owen Defense</h2>

      <p>Black attempts to position their light bishop on b7 and attack the white e-pawn from a distance. To increase
        the
        pressure, Black will frequently play...Nf6.</p>
      <p>If white defends the e-pawn with Nc3, black may play...Bb4 (after first playing...e6 to clear the path for the
        dark
        bishop), threatening to exchange off white's e-pawn defender. Sometimes black will play a later...d5. Everything
        is
        aimed at e4!</p>
      <p>The disadvantage, as with the Modern and Pirc defenses, is obvious: White frequently gains a space advantage
        because black does not contest the center early on. The Owen Defense is one of black's most uncommon defenses
        against the King's Pawn Opening.</p>
      <p>It's worth noting that we can get to the Owen Defense using different move orders, such as 1. e4 e6. 2. d4 b6.
        Despite starting with 1...e6, this is hardly a "French Defense" because black's intention was not to prepare
        the...d5 thrust. Black switches to the Owen Defense by playing the typical early...b6.</p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: 1…Nc6 – The Nimzowitsch Defense</h2>

      <p>Nimzowitsch was a chess legend, but he's better known for other contributions to opening theory than this one.
        Because white's d-pawn is defended by the queen, 1...Nc6 has no effect on the game.</p>
      <p>After 2...e5, White can also play 2. Nf3, allowing black to transpose to a standard 1. e4 e5 opening. Black's
        attempts to avoid a dual King's Pawn Opening are mostly either passive (2...d6) or dubious (2...f5). And if
        black
        is
        fine with playing 2...e5 and transposing, one might wonder why they aren't just playing 1...e5 on move one in
        the
        first place!</p>
      <p>The Nimzowitsch Defense has never been popular with the general public, but developing a piece on move one
        can't
        be
        all bad.</p>
      <h2>Other Defenses: Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>Other than the moves mentioned above, other first moves by black are generally ignored. Moves like 1...a6?!,
        1...h6?!, and 1...f6 have no effect. White can gain more space by playing 2. d4.</p>
