      <h1>King's Pawn Opening</h1>
      <p>
        The King's Pawn Opening, which begins with 1. e4, is one of white's most
        popular and aggressive opening moves.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </header>
    <p>
      White immediately seizes control of the center and opens lines of
      development for his pieces - 1. e4 is clearly in line with opening
      principles. Many top-tier chess players favor the King's Pawn Opening, and
      World Champion Bobby Fischer even called it the "Best by test."
    </p>
    <p>
      Black has several responses to the King’s Pawn Opening. I’m going to break
      them down into three categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Black immediately seizes their share of central space (the symmetrical
        1...e5 or the more double-edged Sicilian Defense: 1...c5).
      </li>
      <li>
        With his d-pawn, Black attacks the white center. (The Scandinavian
        Defense is played immediately after 1...d5, whereas the French Defense
        and Caro-Kann Defense are played after 1...e6 or 1...c6 with the
        intention of following up with 2...d5.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Other defenses where black is not attempting to occupy the center with a
        pawn. White is frequently allowed to construct a large center, but all
        is not lost for black, as we will see shortly!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Black Occupies the Center: 1…e5</h2>
    <p>
      For much of chess's history, 1. e4 e5 was by far the most common opening
      move. We've discussed the benefits of white's first move, so why shouldn't
      black want to replicate it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, 1...e5 is advantageous for the same reasons that 1. E4 is
      advantageous. This is the most common response taught to beginners, and it
      is used all the way up to the World Championship level. Black establishes
      a stronghold in the center and creates lines for his pieces to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll spend a lot of time on this option because it has so many opening
      variations!
    </p>
    <p>
      White typically follows with the extremely logical 2. Nf3. It's difficult
      to ask for more from an opening move than this - white develops a knight,
      moves closer to kingside castling, and directly threatens black's e5 pawn!
      The most common response is 2...Nc6 - black defends the threat against e5
      while also developing his own piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this section, we'll look at alternatives to 2. Nf3 and
      2...Nc6 - but first, let's see how the game can progress from the
      following position:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ruy Lopez, perhaps the most well-known of the King's Pawn Openings, is
      one of the oldest chess openings - after all, it's named after a 16th
      century Spanish priest!
    </p>
    <p>
      And there's a reason it's still popular. White creates a bishop, moves
      closer to casting, and gives black something to worry about: White could
      threaten to exchange this bishop for the black knight on c6, leaving
      black's e5 pawn undefended at the right time!
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Bc4, also known as the Italian Game, is another popular option for
      white. White's bishop looks menacingly at the f7 square, black's weakest
      point, and white is ready to castle next turn if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch Game is composed of 3. d4. Before continuing with piece
      development, White decides to open up the center and create some pawn
      tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ponziani Opening, c3, is difficult to master. White's plan is
      ambitious: on the next turn, he wants to play 4. d4, but unlike in the
      Scotch (see above), if black exchanges his e-pawn for the d-pawn, white
      will be able to recapture with a pawn and maintain a dominant grip in the
      center!
    </p>
    <p>
      3. After black plays the natural 3...Nf6, Nc3 frequently leads to the Four
      Knights Game. The position remains symmetrical, and a little dull in
      comparison to white's more ambitious options listed above - but hey,
      having the move in a symmetrical position can't be a bad thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before proceeding, consider some second-move alternatives for both white
      and black following 1. e4 e5:
    </p>
    <p>Instead of the hugely popular 2. Nf3, white has some alternatives:</p>
    <p>
      The aggressive King's Gambit is f4. White immediately attempts to dislodge
      black's e5 pawn from its stronghold in the center, even if it means giving
      up a pawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      F4 is the aggressive King's Gambit. White immediately tries to dislodge
      black's e5 pawn from its central stronghold, even if it means giving up a
      pawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Center Game is d4. White can either recapture with the queen after
      2...exd4, or play the aggressive 3. c3. This is the Danish Gambit, in
      which white sacrifices a pawn in order to gain a development advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bc4, developing a bishop, is certainly reasonable, but this King's Pawn
      Opening is unlikely to stay in original territory unless white makes some
      speculative moves. White will most likely play Nf3 or Nc3 soon, switching
      to an Italian Opening or Vienna Game (see above).
    </p>
    <p>However, some unique lines such as the Urusov Gambit are possible!</p>
    <p>
      Other options exist, such as 2. Qh5 (The Wayward Queen Attack), but are
      generally regarded as no threat to black with proper play. After 2. Nf3,
      black has some options if they want to avoid the logical 2...Nc6:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Petrov Defense is 2...Nf6. Instead of defending the e-pawn, black
      attacks white's e-pawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philidor Defense is 2...d6. Black defends the e5 pawn calmly, clearing
      the way for his light bishop to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Latvian Gambit and the so-called Elephant Gambit are played at
      2...f5?! and 2...d5?!, respectively. These pawn thrusts are considered
      dubious, but they can be dangerous against an unprepared opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      2…f6? Is the fundamentally flawed Damiano Defense. This is not how you
      defend your e-pawn! White can ignore the f6 pawn and go for e5. 3. Nxe5!
      This black setup is refuted.
