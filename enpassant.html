    <p>
      The en passant rule is a unique and powerful move in chess that allows a
      pawn to capture an opposing pawn that has just moved two squares forward
      from its starting position. This move can only be made by a pawn that is
      on its fifth rank and the capturing pawn must be on an adjacent file and
      on the capturing pawn's fifth rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the en passant rule is to prevent a pawn from using its
      initial two-square move to evade capture by an opposing pawn. Without this
      rule, a pawn could move two squares forward, pass an opposing pawn on an
      adjacent file, and then be immune to capture by that pawn. The en passant
      rule ensures that a pawn that makes this initial two-square move remains
      vulnerable to capture by an opposing pawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      To perform the en passant move, the capturing pawn moves diagonally to the
      square the opposing pawn would have occupied if it had only moved one
      square forward. The captured pawn is then removed from the board as if it
      had been captured normally.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to note that the en passant move can only be made on the
      very next turn after the opposing pawn has made its two-square move. If
      the capturing pawn does not make the en passant move on the next turn, the
      opportunity is lost and the move can no longer be made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The en passant rule can be a powerful tool for skilled chess players, as
      it allows for unexpected and surprising captures. However, it's important
      to use this move strategically and not to rely on it too heavily, as it
      can also leave the capturing pawn vulnerable to attack. With practice and
      careful planning, the en passant move can be a valuable addition to any
      player's chess strategy.
