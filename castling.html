    <p>
      Castling is a fundamental move in chess that enables a player to develop
      their king and rook and secure the king in a safer position. It involves
      moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first rank and
      then moving the rook to the square the king skipped over.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Castling</h2>

    <p>
      There are two types of castling moves - kingside castling and queenside
      castling. In kingside castling, the king moves two squares towards the
      king-side corner and the rook moves to the square the king skipped over.
      In queenside castling, the king moves two squares towards the queen-side
      corner and the rook moves to the square the king crossed over.
    </p>

    <h2>Castling Traps</h2>

    <p>
      While castling is a great move, it can also lead to some traps that a
      player should be aware of. One such trap is the castling trap where a
      player may lure the opponent's king into castling into an unfavorable
      position, which can lead to a loss of material or checkmate. Another trap
      is the Greek Gift Sacrifice, where a player offers a bishop to draw the
      opponent's king into a vulnerable position.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Castling is an essential move that every chess player should learn. It can
      help players protect their king, develop their pieces, and prepare for an
      attack. By understanding the different types of castling, castling traps,
      and famous castling moves, you can improve your overall chess game and
      take your play to the next level.
